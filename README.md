# Tesla Attracting Top Engineers

The following is an article about why Tesla is attracting the top software engineers. https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-vs-gm-software-engineer-talent-lead/

Despite its highly demanding environment, Tesla is widely considered one of the top places to work for engineers who want to be in the auto industry. They achieve this due to multiple factors, the most siginificant being pay. Tesla pays its Senior Engineers about $220,000 per year while a comparable position at GM-who is also trying to create a self-driving vehicle-pays around $137,000 per year. Additionally, Tesla has been able to bridge the gap between automaker and big tech. Thus, it has become a much more innovative place than a traditional car company like GM. To many of these engineers, Tesla is the future because of how evident it is that cars will be reliant on software. 

Comment from Alexander:  I think it was interesting how Tesla creates small meaningful teams. Tesla essentially holds the idea that knowing your work will be impactful is a great motivation and attracts driven people. Interesting read.
